# JavaScript Coding Style Followed

We follow the rules as outlined by [W3C](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_conventions.asp) except where detailed below.

## Where We Differ From W3C

### Indentation

Instead of using the recommended 2 spaces of indentation,
we make use of __4 spaces__, because it tends to increase
readability by making indentation more obvious.

### Function Documentation

We make use of [__JSDoc__](https://github.com/jsdoc/jsdoc), an API
documentation generator for JavaScript.  It follows a style very
similar to that used by Javadoc.  JSDoc provides a uniform,
standard, and unambiguous way for us to document our functions,
thereby reducing the amount of time required for documenting and
the time required for reading said documentation.  Additionally,
using __JSDOC__ allows us to quickly generate nice looking API
documentation.

### Separating Blocks

We use line breaks to separate logical blocks of code.
